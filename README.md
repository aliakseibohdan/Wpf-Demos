**WPF Demo Projects**

This repository contains a set of focused WPF demonstrations illustrating common UI patterns, data handling, and control customization in C#. Each project is self-contained and showcases a specific aspect of WPF development:

1.  **Simple Text Editor** — A basic multi-line text editor with configurable font settings (size, style, family). Font changes are applied dynamically across the entire document. Includes load and save functionality.

2.  **Button Style Redefinition** — Demonstrates control templating and animation in WPF. The button smoothly enlarges by 30% on hover and returns to its original size when the cursor leaves.

3.  **Integer Editing Control** — A custom control combining an input field with increment/decrement buttons. It enforces numeric-only input and maintains values within a defined range.

4.  **Collection Visualization** — Displays and manages a dynamically generated collection of objects. Supports random generation of names and item counts, in-place editing using the integer control, validation of unique names and numeric ranges, automatic total calculation, and item addition or removal via the UI.

Each project is designed to be minimal yet illustrative, highlighting key WPF concepts such as data binding, templating, dependency properties, and user interaction handling.
